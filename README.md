# People-analytics-Serios-sql-case-study
People Analytics or HR Analytics is an increasingly popular focus area
for data professionals. Many business and people decisions which were
traditionally based off senior management gut feels and intuition are
starting to become more data-driven.

This is a case study in the serious sql course using an extract data. In this project I use python and sql to explore and get insights from the employee datasets. This analysis can be further used to create dashboards to drive people analytics reporting.
